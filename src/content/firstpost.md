_If you are dedicated and confident enough for self study ..then a big YES !!_

### If you move forward by self-studying

<b>Biology</b> is 80% from NCERT only…You can attempt 75–80 question just by doing NCERT properly.

Physics….for physics i will suggest to to take a person tutor…because there are few things which you really can’t study without proper support of a experienced tutor. Read Pradeep thoroughly as it is the best book i ever seen for theory….NCERT theory is really very good… For question solving have DC pandey

Chemistry - For inorganic chemistry just follow NCERT only…i am 100% sure that you will not loose even a single mark. For physical again i will suggest you to take a tutor or you can purchase plancess video lectures for chemistry. For organic do NCERT and some reference book(Best is mtg)

With proper study, one can score 540+ by self studying.

BUT

Now imagine yourself sitting in a room, studying alone. Though you are concentrating but you don’t know the amount of competition you’ll have to face in the real EXAM.During the whole year you won’t be able to FACE the competition which exists around you. Above all , home is a place of distractions. You know siblings , neighbors , noises etc. Concentration needs PEACE.

You’ll have mock tests , surprise tests etc in coaching institute. Tutors will tell you a number of tips and tricks when you are a student of a coaching . The tutors have knowledge about each and every chapter. You’ll see that many students are ahead of you in scoring marks in tests. They’ll tell you what is important and what is not that important. There are score cards , rank cards , everything. Their experience will add up to your marks.

WHAT TO DO!!

   <ul> <li>If you are too sure, confident and dedicated - only then move forward with self study.</li>
    <li>If you wish to aim high, go for coaching.</li>
    <li>If you live far away from a coaching institute, buy DLP</li></ul>

For Best Possible Results !!

Enrol with a Reputed Institute with excellent teachers, and then you have to make your best of Self Study at home coupled with lots of daily practice of homework problems.

Students who are very highly self motivated and self disciplined, coupled with parental guidance, support and monitoring are able to clear NEET with self studies alone, but in my opinion it takes a right mix of coaching and a lot of study at home that make the path a lot easier for a lot of students
